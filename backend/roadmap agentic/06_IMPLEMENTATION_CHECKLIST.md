## ðŸš¨ **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Bucket access issues**: Have backup authentication methods ready
- **Agent failures**: Ensure fallback to original system always works
- **Performance problems**: Implement caching and optimization early
- **Integration issues**: Test integration continuously throughout development

### **Quality Risks**
- **Inaccurate parts**: Validate against known good test cases regularly
- **Missing edge cases**: Create comprehensive test scenarios early
- **Poor user experience**: Test with real damage reports throughout

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Scope creep**: Stick to core functionality, enhance later
- **Technical blockers**: Have alternative approaches planned
- **Integration complexity**: Start integration early, not at the end
