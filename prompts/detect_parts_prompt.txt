Instructions:
• FIRST, based on visible badges, grille, lights, shape or registration lookup, identify the vehicle make, model and approximate year. If uncertain set any field to "Unknown" but do not leave blank.
• THEN systematically inspect ALL exterior components for damage:

**CRITICAL: Be EXTREMELY thorough - missing damage costs thousands in insurance claims**

1. **Systematic Visual Inspection Using Parts List:**
   - Go through the parts reference list above systematically
   - For EACH part in the list, check if it shows ANY damage
   - Look for: dents, scratches, cracks, missing pieces, misalignment, paint damage
   - Use EXACT part names from the reference list (not generic terms)
   - Don't assume only one area is damaged - check ALL visible parts

2. **Front End Priority Check (most common damage area):**
   - Hood: Check for dents, creases, misalignment, paint damage
   - Front Bumper Cover: Look for cracks, scratches, deformation, missing pieces
   - Front Grille: Check for broken slats, missing pieces, cracks
   - Left Front Fender: Inspect for dents, scratches, alignment issues
   - Right Front Fender: Inspect for dents, scratches, alignment issues
   - Left Headlight Assembly: Check for cracks, moisture, misalignment
   - Right Headlight Assembly: Check for cracks, moisture, misalignment

3. **Damage Recognition:**
   - ANY visible deformation, however small = damaged part
   - Paint scratches, chips, or discoloration = damaged part
   - Misaligned panels or uneven gaps = damaged part
   - Broken, cracked, or missing components = damaged part

4. **Quality Control - SYSTEMATIC PART CHECKING:**
   - Use the parts reference list as your checklist
   - Check EACH part systematically for any visible damage
   - DO NOT list the same part multiple times
   - Use EXACT part names from the reference list
   - For front-end collisions, typically check:
     * Hood
     * Front Bumper Cover
     * Left Front Fender
     * Right Front Fender
     * Front Grille
     * Left Headlight Assembly
     * Right Headlight Assembly
   - If you find fewer than 3 different damaged parts in a clearly damaged vehicle, re-examine using the parts list

5. Include accurate bounding boxes for each damaged part
6. Validate JSON format before replying
