**METHODOLOGY: SYSTEMATIC CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT INSPECTION**

**STEP 1: DAMAGE AREA IDENTIFICATION**
First, identify all damaged areas in the image:
- Front end (bumper, hood, headlights, grille, fenders)
- Sides (doors, mirrors, pillars, running boards)  
- Rear (bumper, trunk, taillights)
- Top (roof, sunroof)

**STEP 2: PART-BY-PART SYSTEMATIC INSPECTION**
For EACH damaged area identified in Step 1, inspect these specific parts:

**FRONT-END PARTS (CHECK AGGRESSIVELY):**
- Front Bumper Cover ⚠️ CRITICAL: The large plastic covering at the very front - if ANY denting, cracking, or misalignment visible, this is DAMAGED
- Front Bumper Reinforcement  
- Hood
- Left Front Fender ⚠️ CRITICAL: The curved metal panel above the left front wheel - if ANY denting, scratches, or deformation, this is DAMAGED
- Right Front Fender ⚠️ CRITICAL: The curved metal panel above the right front wheel - if ANY denting, scratches, or deformation, this is DAMAGED
- Front Grille
- Left Headlight Assembly ⚠️ Check for cracks, missing pieces, or misalignment
- Right Headlight Assembly ⚠️ Check for cracks, missing pieces, or misalignment
- Front License Plate Bracket

**SIDE PARTS:**
- Left/Right Front Door
- Left/Right Rear Door
- Left/Right Side Mirror
- Left/Right A/B/C-Pillar
- Left/Right Running Board

**REAR PARTS:**
- Rear Bumper Cover
- Trunk/Tailgate
- Left/Right Taillight Assembly
- Rear License Plate Bracket

**STEP 3: DAMAGE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA**
For each damaged part, evaluate:
- **Visible damage types**: dents, scratches, cracks, missing pieces, misalignment, paint damage
- **Severity assessment**: 
  - Minor: Surface scratches, small dents (<2 inches)
  - Moderate: Medium dents (2-6 inches), significant scratches, minor structural damage
  - Severe: Large dents (>6 inches), major structural damage, missing/broken pieces

**STEP 4: QUALITY CONTROL VERIFICATION**
Before finalizing, verify:
- Did I check ALL visible damage in the image?
- Are part names technically accurate?
- Is severity consistent with visible damage?
- Did I miss any obvious damage?

**FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES:**

**Example 1: Front-End Collision**
Image shows: Crumpled front bumper, hood slightly bent, left headlight cracked, grille damaged
Chain-of-thought: "I see front-end impact damage. Let me systematically check each front part: 
1. Front Bumper Cover - severely damaged with major crumpling = SEVERE
2. Hood - minor denting visible = MODERATE  
3. Left Headlight Assembly - lens cracked = MODERATE
4. Front Grille - multiple broken sections = MODERATE
Quality check: I covered all visible front damage."

**Example 2: Side Impact**
Image shows: Driver door dented, side mirror hanging, B-pillar scratched
Chain-of-thought: "I see left side impact. Checking side parts systematically:
1. Left Front Door - major denting across surface = SEVERE
2. Left Side Mirror - hanging/damaged = MODERATE
3. Left B-Pillar - surface scratches = MINOR
Quality check: All visible side damage documented."

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use EXACT technical part names
- Look for ALL damage, not just the most obvious
- Front-end collisions typically damage 4-8 different parts
- Side impacts typically damage 3-6 different parts
- Be thorough - insurance requires comprehensive assessment
